All my adaptive image steganography programs for my science fair project.

My project focuses on steganography which is a way of hiding information (like a secret message) in another medium (like the pixels of an image).
The change in the pixels is so slight that it cannot be detected by a human eye. One of the ways steganography is used in the real world is for
companies to watermark images they own to rights to. Adaptive steganography is where the algorithm or placement of information within the cover
image changes depending on the contents of the image to make the hidden message less likely to be deciphered by an unintended audience.
Each file in this repository tells the method of adaptive steganography used then whether it encodes or decodes the hidden message in the image.
